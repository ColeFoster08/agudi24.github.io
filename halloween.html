<h2>It's Halloween! It's Halloween!<br>
The moon is full and bright<br>
And we shall see what can't be seen<br>
On any other night<br>
Skeletons and ghosts and ghouls<br>
Grinning goblins fighting duels<br>
Werewolves rising from their tombs<br>
Witches on their magic brooms<br>
In masks and gown<br>
We haunt the street<br>
And knock on doors<br>
For trick or treat<br>
Tonight we are<br>
The king and queen<br>
For oh tonight<br>
It's HALLOWEEN!<br>
